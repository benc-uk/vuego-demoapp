## Go & Vue.js - Demo Web Application

This is a simple web application with a Go server/backend and a Vue.js SPA (Single Page Application) frontend.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

- The SPA component was created using the Vue CLI and uses [Bootstrap-Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). In addition [Gauge.js](http://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/) is used for the dials in the monitoring view
- The Go component is a Go HTTP server based on the std http package and using [gopsutils](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) for monitoring metrics, and [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for routing

## Server API

The Go server component performs two tasks

- Serve the Vue.js app to the user. As this is a SPA, this is static content, i.e. HTML, JS & CSS files and any images. Note. The Vue.js app needs to be 'built' before it can be served, this bundles everything up correctly.
- Provide a simple REST API for data to be displayed & rendered by the Vue.js app. This API is very simple currently has three routes:
  - `GET /api/info` - Returns system information and various properties as JSON
  - `GET /api/metrics` - Returns monitoring metrics for CPU, memory, disk and network. This data comes from the _gopsutils_ library
  - `GET /api/weather` - Returns weather data for the location determined automatically from the calling IP address, uses IPStack and DarkSky REST APIs

## Building & Running Locally

### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/doc/install) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [cosmtrek/air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air#go) - if using `make watch-server`
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - for running as a container, or image build and push
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux) - for deployment to Azure

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/benc-uk/vuego-demoapp.git
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```text

```

Make file variables and default values, pass these in when calling `make`, e.g. `make image IMAGE_REPO=blah/foo`

| Makefile Variable | Default               |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| IMAGE_REG         | ghcr<span>.</span>io  |
| IMAGE_REPO        | benc-uk/vuego-demoapp |
| IMAGE_TAG         | latest                |
| AZURE_RES_GROUP   | temp-demoapps         |
| AZURE_REGION      | uksouth               |
| AZURE_SITE_NAME   | nodeapp-{git-sha}     |

- The server will listen on port 4000 by default, change this by setting the environmental variable `PORT`
- The server will ry to serve static content (i.e. bundled SPA frontend) from the same directory as the server binary, change this by setting the environmental variable `CONTENT_DIR`
- The SPA frontend will use `/api` as the API endpoint, when working locally `VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINT` is set and overrides this to be `http://localhost:4000/api`

# Containers

Public container image is [available on GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/benc-uk/packages/container/package/vuego-demoapp)

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 ghcr.io/benc-uk/vuego-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

## Kubernetes

The app can easily be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm, see [deploy/kubernetes/readme.md](deploy/kubernetes/readme.md) for details

## Running in Azure App Service (Linux)

If you want to deploy to an Azure Web App as a container (aka Linux Web App), a Bicep template is provided in the [deploy](deploy/) directory

For a super quick deployment, use `make deploy` which will deploy to a resource group, temp-demoapps and use the git ref to create a unique site name

```bash
make deploy
```

# Config

Environmental variables

- `WEATHER_API_KEY` - Enable the weather feature with a DarkSky API key
- `IPSTACK_API_KEY` - Enable the weather feature with a IPStack API key
- `PORT` - Port to listen on (default: `4000`)
- `CONTENT_DIR` - Directory to serve static content from (default: `.`)
- `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` - Set to a Azure AD registered app if you wish to enable the optional user login feature

### Optional User Login Feature

The application can be configured with an optional user sign-in feature which uses Azure Active Directory as an identity platform. This uses wrapper & helper libraries from https://github.com/benc-uk/msal-graph-vue

If you wish to enable this, carry out the following steps:

- Register an application with Azure AD, [see these steps](https://github.com/benc-uk/msal-graph-vue#set-up--deployment)
- Set the environmental variable `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` on the Go server, with the value of the client id. This can be done in the `.env` file if working locally.
- _Optional_ when testing/debugging the Vue.js SPA without the Go server, you can place the client in `.env.development` under the value `VUE_APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`

# GitHub Actions CI/CD

A working set of CI and CD release GitHub Actions workflows are provided `.github/workflows/`, automated builds are run in GitHub hosted runners
